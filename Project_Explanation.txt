Drone Telemetry Web Dashboard – Short Explanation

1.  What I Built I created a web-based drone telemetry simulation
    dashboard that visually displays real-time flight data similar to a
    drone ground-control telemetry window. The dashboard shows the
    following parameters:

-   Altitude
-   Speed
-   Battery Percentage
-   GPS Coordinates

The interface updates the telemetry values every 1 second for 30
seconds, matching the internship task requirements.

2.  How It Works The system is implemented as a front-end web
    application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

-   HTML structures the telemetry dashboard layout and data fields.
-   CSS provides a dark aerospace-style UI, card layout, and responsive
    design for clear visualization.
-   JavaScript simulates real drone behavior by:
    -   Generating small random variations in altitude, speed, battery,
        and GPS position.
    -   Updating the displayed values once per second using a timer
        function.
    -   Stopping the simulation automatically after 30 seconds.

This creates a realistic live telemetry monitoring experience similar to
professional drone mission-planner interfaces.

3.  Tools and Software Used

Development Technologies - HTML5 – dashboard structure - CSS3 – styling
and layout - JavaScript (Vanilla JS) – telemetry simulation logic

Software & Environment - Web Browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox) for running
the dashboard - Command Prompt / Local Python HTTP Server (optional) for
professional local hosting - Code Editor such as VS Code or Notepad++

No external libraries or frameworks were used to keep the solution
lightweight, simple, and portable.

4.  Key Features

-   Real-time 1-second telemetry updates
-   Automatic 30-second simulation cycle
-   Clean visual dashboard layout
-   No installation or dependencies required
-   Easy to extend with graphs, gauges, or live maps

5.  Conclusion This project demonstrates my ability to:

-   Translate aerospace telemetry concepts into a working software
    interface
-   Build a real-time simulation system
-   Design a clear and professional user interface
-   Deliver a complete, well-structured internship submission

The solution is simple, functional, and easily expandable into a full
drone ground-control dashboard.
